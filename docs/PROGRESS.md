# Progress

Status: fee collector uses the native Google Sheets player master; cash receipts collect the full outstanding balance
Last updated: 2026-10-05

## Completed

- GitHub repository identity is now documented as `Mitsuru-sato37/simpsons-team-os`.
- Existing Apps Script fee collector is connected by design to spreadsheet ID `1yVT9_c1RVdnosvZlN3r2bse6B3NtJo9JvKDggqDI61E`.
- Deterministic next-open-game selection and receipt projection helpers were added.
- Payment double-submit protection remains backed by the Apps Script lock and active-receipt recheck.
- Game completion now uses a lock and selects the next open game.
- Cancelled receipts remain in the sheet and are shown in a separate collapsed `取消履歴` section.
- Repository design and implementation plan were added under `docs/superpowers/`.
- Unpaid-player cards now use the operational labels `現金300円` and `PayPay確認`.
- Unpaid-player cards now also expose `銀行振込確認`; bank transfer is manually confirmed and stored as a receipt method.
- `完了` と `中止` の試合は手動選択して確認できるが、完了操作を再実行できない。Apps Script側も状態を確認して更新を拒否する。
- `codex/fee-collector` was merged into `main` on 2026-10-05.
- Existing private Apps Script web app was updated to deployment version 3 with player-master integration; the web app URL is unchanged.
- The original Excel player master was deleted after conversion, as requested.
- The Excel player master was converted to native Google Sheets; the native copy is now the source of truth.
- Fee collector source now resolves participant IDs against the master and displays master jersey numbers and names.
- Cash collection now records the full outstanding balance and labels the button with that amount; PayPay and bank-transfer actions retain the 300-yen per-action cap.
- The private Apps Script web app was updated to deployment version 4 at the existing URL; the live sample with a 500-yen balance displayed `現金500円`.
- Confirmed the current participant workflow: attendance is entered per game in `参加者` with game ID and player ID; player names resolve from the master, but there is no in-app roster picker yet.

## Verification

- Existing checks from the prior player-master integration: `node --test tests/fee-collector-logic.test.mjs` — 17 tests passed (2026-10-05); `git diff --check`.
- Visually inspected the live version 4 web app: sample game showed 6 participants, ¥2,000 billed, ¥1,500 received, ¥500 outstanding, and `現金500円` for the unpaid player. No receipt/payment action was triggered.
- Google Sheets metadata and headers were checked for `試合`, `参加者`, `受領履歴`, and `当日集金`.
- Native player master metadata and `選手マスター!A1:C12` were checked; the live web app version 4 loaded the real collection data successfully without creating a new receipt.

## Remaining scope

- Run an iPhone operation test against the updated private Apps Script web app.
- Consider adding an in-app player-master picker to register participants per game without manually entering IDs; no such UI exists yet.
- PayPay API integration, authentication, and public deployment remain out of scope.

## Handoff

Current branch: `codex/player-master-integration`

Next task: perform an iPhone operation test, including jersey-number display, full-balance cash collection, PayPay/bank-transfer confirmation, receipt display, cancellation, duplicate-tap prevention, and automatic next-game selection. Decide whether to add a player-master picker for per-game participant registration.

The merged `main` branch must be pushed before switching PCs. Keep the spreadsheet ID in configuration/documentation only and do not commit deployment secrets.
